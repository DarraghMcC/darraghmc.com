      <description>Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m Darragh! Interacting with people can be complex and as a subset of people, this is also true of managers. To try to somewhat help with this complexity, the following is my humble attempt at capturing some context and details about myself as a manager and a person.&#xA;This is intended to be an aid for those I work with and is not required reading - I make no assumptions, it has been read and this is definitely not a replacement for building a working relationship together.</description>

      <description>This site A few details on the construction of this website. I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt that some security flaw is going to make me regret being so transparent, but such is the price I pay for being so open!&#xA;As someone who tries hard to avoid over-engineering solutions in a professional environment, I evidently scratch that itch with my personal projects and this website is a stellar example of this. As you have probably seen from the landing page, the site structure is pretty basic.</description>
